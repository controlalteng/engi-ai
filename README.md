## ⚙️ What is Engi AI?

Engi AI is both a **character** and a **project** — designed to teach, explore and develop small-scale engineering and AI solutions.  
She represents the fusion of **mechanical systems, process optimization and artificial intelligence** — guiding engineers into the digital era.

This repository will grow into a collection of:
- 🧠 **Educational notebooks** explaining engineering + data science fundamentals  
- ⚙️ **Python scripts** for SPC, KPIs, process monitoring, and automation  
- 📊 **Dashboards and visualizations** for data-driven decision making  
- 🤖 **AI experiments** applying machine learning to manufacturing and quality control
